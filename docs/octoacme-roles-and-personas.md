## Role Handoffs & Collaboration

Successful project delivery depends on clear handoffs and collaboration between roles. This section outlines typical handoff points and accountability:

### Typical Project Flow
1. **Business Analyst â†’ Product Manager**: BA gathers initial requirements and business needs; PdM prioritizes and defines product vision
2. **Product Manager â†’ UX Designer**: PdM shares feature requirements and success criteria; UX Designer creates user flows and designs
3. **UX Designer â†’ Developers**: Designer provides mockups, prototypes, and specifications; Developers implement features
4. **Developers â†’ QA Engineers**: Developers deliver completed features with unit tests; QA validates against acceptance criteria
5. **QA Engineers â†’ DevOps Engineer**: QA confirms test results and release readiness; DevOps deploys to production
6. **DevOps Engineer â†’ Technical Writer**: DevOps confirms deployment; Technical Writer updates documentation for new features
7. **Technical Writer â†’ Stakeholders**: Documentation published; Product ready for customer communication and training

### RACI Model for Key Deliverables

| Deliverable | Product Manager | Business Analyst | UX Designer | Developer | QA Engineer | DevOps Engineer | Technical Writer | Project Manager |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Requirements | A | R | C | C | C | I | I | I |
| Design | A | C | R | C | I | I | I | I |
| Implementation | C | I | C | R | C | I | I | I |
| Testing | C | I | I | C | R | C | I | I |
| Deployment | I | I | I | I | C | R | I | C |
| Documentation | C | C | C | C | I | I | R | I |
| Release | A | I | I | C | C | R | C | R |

**Legend**: R = Responsible (does the work), A = Accountable (owns the outcome), C = Consulted (provides input), I = Informed (kept updated)

### Handoff Best Practices
- **Make handoffs explicit**: Use clear signals (e.g., status changes, notifications, handoff meetings)
- **Document dependencies**: Track what each role needs from others in the project plan
- **Define "done"**: Each handoff should have clear acceptance criteria
- **Communicate blockers early**: Escalate delays that impact downstream roles
- **Use the persona assignment checklist**: Ensure all roles are assigned and understand their responsibilities at project start
