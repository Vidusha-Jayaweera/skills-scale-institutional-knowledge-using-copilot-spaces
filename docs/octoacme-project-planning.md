# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Role Handoffs & RACI

Clear role ownership and handoffs are critical for smooth execution. Document role assignments and accountability using the **[Persona Assignment Checklist](./octoacme-persona-assignment-checklist.md)**.

### Key Activities
- Complete the persona assignment checklist during planning kickoff
- Define RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) for all major deliverables
- Document handoff points between roles (e.g., Design → Development → QA → DevOps)
- Ensure each team member understands their responsibilities and who they hand off to
- Review the [Roles & Personas](./octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) guide for role definitions and collaboration patterns

### Best Practices
- Make handoffs explicit with clear triggers and acceptance criteria
- Identify and document cross-team dependencies early
- Assign backup owners for critical roles
- Review role assignments if scope or team composition changes

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
