# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

**Welcome to OctoAcme's Project Management Hub!**

This is the central entry point for all project management documentation at OctoAcme. Whether you're a new team member ramping up, a project manager coordinating a delivery, or a stakeholder looking for process guidelines, this hub organizes our lightweight, iterative approach to shipping customer value. Use this page to navigate to detailed guides for each phase of our project lifecycle, understand key roles and responsibilities, and access templates and best practices.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a **lightweight, iterative project management lifecycle** designed to deliver customer value through small, testable increments. Our approach balances structure with flexibility, enabling teams to move quickly while maintaining quality and alignment.

Our **five-phase lifecycle** guides projects from idea to retrospective: **Initiation** (validate the problem, align stakeholders, and define success metrics), **Planning** (break work into a prioritized backlog with clear acceptance criteria and timelines), **Execution & Tracking** (build and test iteratively using our project board workflow and PR practices), **Release & Deployment** (deploy safely with CI gates, automated testing, and rollback plans), and **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** (capture learnings and action items to improve future work). Each phase has clear deliverables, decision gates, and quality checkpoints to keep projects on track.

**Roles and collaboration** are central to our success. The **Product Manager (PdM)** defines outcomes and prioritizes the backlog based on customer value. The **Project Manager (PM)** coordinates schedules, manages risks, and ensures clear communication across teams. **Developers** implement features with a focus on quality and testability, while **QA specialists** validate acceptance criteria through automated and manual testing. **Stakeholders** provide input, approvals, and feedback throughout the lifecycle. We use a consistent **communication cadence** including daily standups (15 min, focused on progress and blockers), weekly PM + PdM syncs, bi-weekly or end-of-sprint demos, monthly stakeholder updates, and an escalation path from team-level triage to PM to Product Lead to Sponsor.

**Quality assurance and risk management** are embedded at every stage. Our **CI pipeline** enforces automated testing, linting, and security scanning before any code is merged. We require small PRs (ideally <= 400 lines) with at least one approval, and we run smoke tests before production releases. A **Risk Register** tracks identified risks with impact, likelihood, owner, and mitigation plans, reviewed weekly during syncs. Our **release checklist** includes staging validation, rollback plans, release notes, and post-deployment verification. We maintain a **blameless culture** and use retrospectives to convert incidents and challenges into actionable improvements.

## How to Use These Docs

**For new projects:**
- Start with the [Project Initiation](./octoacme-project-initiation.md) guide to create your one-pager and align stakeholders.
- Move into [Project Planning](./octoacme-project-planning.md) once you have approval, then use [Execution & Tracking](./octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) to deliver iteratively.
- Keep your **Project Charter** and **README** updated in your project repository so the team and stakeholders have a single source of truth.

**For ongoing projects:**
- Reference [Risk Management & Communication](./octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) for stakeholder updates and risk tracking.
- Use the [Release & Deployment](./octoacme-release-and-deployment.md) checklist to ensure safe, high-quality releases.
- Schedule retrospectives following the [Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](./octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md) guide after each milestone or sprint.

**For Copilot Spaces context:**
- Add process-specific documentation to your project's `.copilot/` directory if you want GitHub Copilot Spaces to use it as context when providing role-specific guidance or answering project questions.
- For example, you might add your project's risk register, Definition of Done, or custom templates to `.copilot/` so Copilot can help with context-aware suggestions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Content aligns with the existing process documentation in the `docs/` folder
- [x] The README improves clarity, provides a navigable hub, and closes any gaps in discoverability
- [ ] Stakeholder review and feedback incorporated (pending)
